# FemtoDstMaker 
** generates a reduced file format for the proton momments analysis **

The code includes a few makers:
1. StFemtoDstMaker     (takes picoDst and generates rootfiles with StFemtoEvent)
2. StFemtoEvent        (reduced event class, Event info and array of StFemtoTracks)
3. StFemtoTrack        (reduced track class, mainly momentum and dE/dx nSigmas)
4. EpdPileUpRejection  (just used to calculate nMipEPD. Not used in analysis)
5. StEpdUtil           (just used to calculate nMipEPD. Not used in analysis)

How to compile and run the code:
  
First, the code needs to be compiled. Run the following lines:
`
> setup 64bits
> cons
`

Second, edit the run.sh and change the file paths to convient out, log and scheduler directory (outDir, logDir and schedDir):
`
outDir=/star/data01/pwg/your_directory/fDsts/  
logDir=/star/data01/pwg/your_directory/fDsts_log/
schedDir=/star/data01/pwg/your_directory/fDsts_sched/
goodRunList=/star/u/sheppel/femtoRepo/FemtoDstMaker/filelist/good_3GeV.txt
`
You can leave the goodRunList as the current path or obtain the good run list from https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/system/files/good_3GeV.txt

Then, it you just run ./run.sh and wait for the jobs to finish

> ./run.sh
